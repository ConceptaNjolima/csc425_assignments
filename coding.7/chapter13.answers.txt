Question 2:
- Free memory=7960 Megabytes
- Used memory=602 Megabytes
Do these numbers much my intution? No, I did not know how much memory to expect. I had no intuition on any specific numbers.

Question 4:
- The total memory stayed the same. The used memory increased to 671 Megabytes.
When I killed the memory-user program, the used memory decreased and the available space increased. 
This matches my expectation since killing the program frees the memory that the program was using

While running the program with large amounts of memory,the total,used, free, and available memory values stayed the same. However, when I killed the process, the available memory value increased.


Question6: How I got the process IDs to check with pmap
- I added a line inside my program that gets the process id using getpid()

Question 7:
- With the -X flag, I see information on the device, size, anonymous, lazy free, swap, swap pss, mapping and other details about the process. I also see total memory values(in KB) under each memory category.
- I see the vvar, vdso, vsyscall, libc-2.31.so, Id-2.31.so in addition to stack, heap, and code
